# Test cases for print_square function
==================================

Import the function:
    >>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square

Test normal cases:
    >>> print_square(4)
    ####
    ####
    ####
    ####
    >>> print_square(1)
    #
    >>> print_square(0)
    

Test error cases:
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square(-1)
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be >= 0

    >>> try:
    ...     print_square(3.5)
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer

    >>> try:
    ...     print_square(-3.5)
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer

    >>> try:
    ...     print_square("3")
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer
